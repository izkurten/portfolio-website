The link to the [website.](https://yavorkalaydzhiev.com/index.html)

It's a basic website for my friend who needs exposure as an aspiring designer and artist. 
I used HTML, CSS and JS for the build and hosted it. It lacks security but there is no vulnerable information
on there. My next projects will be more developer therefore keep to standard security practices.
